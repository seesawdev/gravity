## 4.x Releases

## Instructions on upgrading to 4.23.0+

Upgrading clusters to Gravity 4.23.0 works via the command line interface (CLI) only.
To upgrade a cluster with an application packaged with the Gravity 4.23+
follow the procedure below.

First, the application must be published into the Ops Center. This allows
all connected clusters to see that a new version is available.

On a cluster side, download the new update by logging into one of the cluster nodes and
executing the command below:

```bash
$ gravity update download
```

The next step is to download the latest version of the `gravity` binary.
For example, if upgrading to 4.26.0:

```bash
$ curl https://get.gravitational.io/telekube/bin/4.26.0/linux/x86_64/gravity -o /tmp/gravity
$ chmod +x /tmp/gravity
```

Finally, launch the update process:

```bash
$ /tmp/gravity upgrade
```

This will upgrade the cluster and the system instance of the `gravity` binary,
so the temporary copy in `/tmp` can be discarded.
